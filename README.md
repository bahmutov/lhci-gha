## Install

Add this module as a dev dependency

```
# install using NPM
$ npm i -D lhci-gha
# install using Yarn
$ yarn add -D lhci-gha
```

## Scripts

This module provides 2 command line scripts. You should use these scripts _after_ running Lighthouse CI

```yml
# https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci
- name: run Lighthouse CI
  run: |
    npm install -g @lhci/cli@0.11.x
    lhci collect
# post performance summary and set the commit status
# https://github.com/bahmutov/lhci-gha
- name: Post performance summary üìä
  run: npx post-summary --report-filename lighthouse-results.json
```

### post-summary

Reads the Lighthouse JSON report and writes GitHub Lighthouse job summary

![Performance job summary](./images/job-summary.png)

- `--report-filename` Lighthouse performance JSON filename
- `--title` summary table title

### post-status

Reads the Lighthouse JSON report and sets the GitHub Commit status

![Performance commit status](./images/commit-status.png)

- `--report-filename` Lighthouse performance JSON filename
- `--owner` GitHub repo owner, like `bahmutov
- `--repo` GitHub repo name, like `web-performance-example`
- `--commit` Commit to set the status on
- `--target-url` Link to add to the commit status, usually to the job

Usually for pull requests, you would use the head commit SHA

```yml
- name: Post performance commit status ‚úÖ
  run: |
    npx post-status --min 90 \
      --report-filename lighthouse-results.json \
      --owner bahmutov --repo web-performance-example \
      --commit ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha || github.sha }} \
      --target-url "${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}"
  env:
    PERSONAL_GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_GH_TOKEN }}
```

### post-comment

Posts or updates a performance comment on specific issue or pull request

![Posted comment](./images/comment.png)

- `--report-filename` Lighthouse performance JSON filename
- `--owner` GitHub repo owner, like `bahmutov
- `--repo` GitHub repo name, like `web-performance-example`
- `--issue` pull request or issue number to comment on
- `--title` the start of the comment body, like "Performance metric"

This script checks all comments on PR to find the one that starts with "\*\*${title}" text, if found it updates it. Otherwise, it posts a new comment.

```yml
- name: Post performance comment üìù
  if: github.event.pull_request
  run: |
    npx post-comment \
      --report-filename lighthouse-results.json \
      --owner bahmutov --repo web-performance-example \
      --pr ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
  env:
    PERSONAL_GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_GH_TOKEN }}
```
